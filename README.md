# Offline Demo of the National Basemap

This project provides an offline demo of the National Basemap, showcasing an offline basemap of
Vilnius city and an area extending 100 km around the Vilnius track. The demo is implemented using
the `flutter_map` library. This example serves as a guide for implementing similar functionality in
other libraries such as OpenLayers and Maplibre.
